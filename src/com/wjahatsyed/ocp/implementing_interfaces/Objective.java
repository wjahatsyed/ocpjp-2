     2.5 Develop code that declares, implements, and/or extends interfaces and use the @Override annotation

     When you implement an interface, you are agreeing to adhere to the contract defined in the interface.
     That means you are agreeing to provide legal implementations for every abstract method defined in the interface.


     The code shall never compile if you declare to implement a specific interface but do not fulfill the
     contract but implementing the methods.
